# NVIDIA-Deepstream
This repository contains Python bindings and sample applications for the DeepStream SDK. The bindings sources along with build instructions are now available under bindings!

It is our deepstream repository. We used custom deep learning models in various tasks with Deepstream SDK. It is very similar to python bindings of Deepstream but for different tasks.
